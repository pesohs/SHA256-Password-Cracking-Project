This repository is intended **solely for educational and ethical cybersecurity research purposes**.  
The SHA256 password-cracking script provided here is designed to demonstrate concepts such as:

- How hashing works
- How SHA256 compares to other hashing algorithms
- Why using weak or common passwords is insecure
- How attackers may attempt offline brute force or dictionary-based cracking
- How defenders can build better security practices by understanding offensive techniques
